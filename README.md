# YAPT
Yet Another Pomodoro Timer (aka squishy-timer)

Right now this just has the details so far.   The current main.py has visualization code I'm happy with for the effect I think.  Next is to make it work.


In the deprecated folder was a simple circuit board that I was going to build....but it was adding delays to actually getting it done.  So this is left as an artifact and to show the pinouts if you want.



For more info on the hardware build please see https://hackaday.io/project/180733-yapt
